## Log

_Append one line per completed stage: date, what shipped, what changed from the plan._

**2026-08-16 — task 0.10, test scaffolding.** 192 backend tests pass (155 before). New: `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/integration/test_auth.py`, `tests/integration/test_items_rows.py`. Both corrections 0.9 recorded are closed — `RegisterRequest.display_name` is required and trimmed, `POST /auth/login`'s `401` carries `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`.

Changed from the plan, all recorded in `DECISIONS.md` 072–075:

- The `display_name` fix as specified (`Field(strip_whitespace=True)`) does nothing in Pydantic v2 and was respelled with `StringConstraints`.
- The test database is a separate `postgres:18` container named by `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, with an import-time guard against pointing it at `DATABASE_URL`.
- `pyproject.toml` needed `pythonpath = ["."]` as well as the `eval` marker: the bare `pytest` in `07-DEPLOYMENT.md`'s CI step could not import `app` at all.
- Documented Postgres 16 corrected to 18 in four documents; CI's `postgres:16` pin is 5.5's.

**Stage 0 is closed.** The last open criterion — `GET /health` returning `db: "ok"` — was verified manually after the 0.10 commit, against a running server on the Neon database: `{"status":"ok","db":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}`. It is a manual check rather than a test because it needs a live server and a reachable database; nothing in the suite covers it.

**2026-08-16 — before task 1.1, four behaviours reassigned across stages.** The `status` filter, the `created_at DESC, short_id` ordering, the `include_archived` exclusion and `limit`'s default and cap all shipped at 0.7 and were left undefended at 0.10, implicitly falling to task 5.2. They now belong to 1.4 (status filter, archived exclusion — both written at that task's start), 1.5 (limit) and 1.7 (ordering). Recorded here rather than only in the stage files because it is a change to the plan, not a change to the code.
